# MATS Application: Geometric Analysis of High-Fidelity SAE Features

## 1. Proven Capability: Completed "RelP-SAE" Implementation
I have already developed and validated **RelP-SAE**, a novel methodology that addresses the critical "faithfulness crisis" in SAE feature attribution. The project, including a full validation against ground truth, is complete and demonstrates my ability to execute novel, rigorous interpretability research.

### Key Finding
My validation work revealed that all current attribution methods, including my novel RelP-SAE, have a surprisingly weak correlation with activation patching ground truth. This critical finding motivates the need for a deeper, more structural understanding of SAE features.

## 2. Proposed MATS Project: Geometric Interpretability
My MATS project will build directly on this foundation by asking the next logical question: **Do the geometric properties of SAE features predict their causal importance?**

### Research Goals
- **Characterize Feature Geometry:** Analyze the geometric structure of features identified as important by different attribution methods.
- **Connect Geometry to Faithfulness:** Develop a "geometric faithfulness score" to predict a feature's causal effect without expensive patching experiments.
- **Understand Method Divergence:** Investigate the geometric basis for why different attribution methods identify different features.

## 3. Long-Term Vision: A Bridge to Quantum Interpretability
This project creates the perfect methodological bridge to my long-term goal of pioneering Quantum Mechanistic Interpretability. The geometric analysis frameworks I will develop for classical SAEs are directly transferable to interpreting the geometrically-rich feature spaces of quantum and hybrid models. This creates a clear research trajectory:

**Completed Work** ➡️ **MATS Project (Geometric Analysis)** ➡️ **Future Impact (Quantum Interpretability)**
(Classical Faithfulness) ➡️ (Structural Understanding) ➡️ (Novel Application Domain)

This application demonstrates a track record of delivering concrete results on hard problems and a clear, strategic vision for advancing the frontiers of interpretability.
